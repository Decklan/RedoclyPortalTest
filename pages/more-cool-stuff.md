# Guess What?
With an enterprise account we can get things like:

## Oh boy.. another list
- Azure integration
- SSO functionality
- Developer portal access.. cuz we kinda want that
- Custom domain for portal
- etc

## BUT WAIT! There's more..
This developer portal is a React app.. so it fits nicely with the fact that we already use React.
The project uses MD and MDX files. MDX files are markdown files that have React integration so you can build
and render React components in them. Pretty cool stuff!
